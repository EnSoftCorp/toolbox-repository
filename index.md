## Overview
The Toolbox Repository is a collection of [Atlas](http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/) program analysis toolbox plugins. A toolbox is a collection of reusable or domain-specific analysis logic. This site provides a simple composite update site to easily install a toolbox plugin and its dependencies.

## Toolbox Installation

4. In the `Available Software` dialog, select the checkbox next to each toolbox you wish to install and click `Next` followed by `OK`.
5. In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click `Next`.
6. Read and accept the license agreements, then click `Finish`. If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click `OK`.
