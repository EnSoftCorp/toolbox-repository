Atlas for Brainfuck adds Atlas code mapping support and graph based interpreter support for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programs. This plugin has no dependencies other than Atlas, but is compatible with the [Brainf*ck Development Tools](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/brainfck-development-tools) plugin.
